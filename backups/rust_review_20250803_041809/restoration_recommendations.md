# Rust Code Restoration Recommendations

Generated on: Sun  3 Aug 2025 04:22:06 +06

## Summary
This document contains recommendations for improving and completing the Warp terminal Rust codebase.

## Critical Issues to Address

### 1. TODO Items Requiring Implementation
- Command history specific session filtering
- Theme picker functionality
- Font family and size input handling
- Window size and opacity controls
- Syntax highlighting for search results
- Timeline view for command history
- Bookmark and tagging functionality

### 2. Missing Functionality
- Directional pane navigation implementation
- Advanced error pattern analysis
- Daily activity tracking
- Directory usage statistics
- Command trend analysis

### 3. Code Quality Improvements
- Replace TODO comments with proper implementations
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Implement missing test cases
- Add documentation for public APIs

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority
1. Complete command history functionality
2. Implement theme management system
3. Add comprehensive settings input validation
4. Implement pane navigation system

### Medium Priority
1. Add analytics and usage tracking
2. Implement batch command processing
3. Add syntax highlighting support
4. Improve error handling and reporting

### Low Priority
1. Add advanced search features
2. Implement plugin system extensions
3. Add performance monitoring
4. Enhance UI animations and transitions

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Fix all compilation warnings
   - Implement critical TODO items
   - Add missing mod.rs files where needed

2. **Short-term Goals (1-2 weeks)**
   - Complete command history functionality
   - Implement basic theme management
   - Add comprehensive error handling

3. **Long-term Goals (1-2 months)**
   - Full feature implementation
   - Comprehensive testing suite
   - Performance optimization
   - Documentation completion

## Technical Debt

The codebase shows good structure but has several areas of technical debt:
- Multiple TODO items indicating incomplete features
- Some placeholder implementations
- Missing error handling in some areas
- Incomplete test coverage

## Conclusion

The Warp terminal codebase is well-structured and compiles successfully. The main areas for improvement are completing the TODO items and implementing the missing functionality outlined above.
